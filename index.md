## Task = Developer
### There is more than enough knowledge available to become a competent programmer, software developer, web developer and get money in the process.

### Why am I here?
* I want to work for myself
* I want a career that can provide for me and my partner
* I want to become the best programmer I can

### One Goal
This goal is to become a capable developer of both software and web applications, anywhere, for me or for someone else while getting PAID

### What makes up a capable developer?
1. Is there a problem that someone will pay to have solved?
2. Is there a problem that someone will needs solved using software?
3. Can we create stuff that solves problems?
4. Can we create stuff that is usable, maybe even (dare I say it) fun to use?
5. Can we create stuff that is secure?
6. Can we create stuff that works?
7. Can we create stuff that makes us $$$ both for ourselves and for other people?

## How Long will this take to complete?
When it comes down to it these goals could be achieved at any point on this list. The goal is to GET WHAT WE WANT not to tick a bunch of boxes. 

**The question isn't how long will it take, it's what do we want and why do we want it?**
It's not about creating software because it "pays gud", it's about developing the skills to solve problems, think critically and learning to market and sell (whether thats your software or your skills).

These links will help us on our path to creating our empire. Whatever that means, it's not going to be easy. While the rest of the normies are liking each other on social media, drinking, watching shit tv, we will be grinding away at building this empire. 

## Math and Reading
Math is going to help us learn to think the way we should be thinking in terms of software. I hate maths but it needs to turn into a love/hate relationship where I practice it no matter what. I don't need to do a lot but I need to be comfortable with it if I want to earn the big $$$

I also need to read and read a lot. Progamming involes running into tonnes of problems and a lot of the time the only way to find the answer is to READ. Reading is like skilling. If you don't do it, you're not going to get good at it. By reading we build a foundation of knowledge that (without injury) cannot be taken away which means we can come up with answers faster and faster.

## Proof that we are learning
When it comes to learning, practice makes perfect and it's not about quality, its about quantity. 
As I move through this I will be making a lot of stuff which requires documenting what I'm learning, how I'm learning and why I'm learning it. 

1. I will create a website that will progress along with my skills. Using this website I can talk about
  * what I'm working on
  * what I'm learning
  * what I'm having problems with
  * how I solved these problems
  * generally stuff I find interesting
2. I will use GitHub repositories to 
  * learn about GitHub
  * house versions of my website
  * house versions of the software programs, web pages, text files, and other things
3. I will have a CodePen where I can
  * show off HTML experimentation
  * show off CSS experimentation
  * show off JavaScript experimentation
  * show off whatever else I think is interesting
4. I will join groups, forums and chats

## What tools do I need?
1. A computer that is mine
2. Access to the internet
3. A place to take and store notes
4. PERSONAL GRIT
> Nothing about being extraordinary is easy. If it was the word wouldn't exist

## Recommended Tools
1. Small notebook carried on me to write ideas at any moment
2. Pens because you never know when you'll need one to write down your number for that important contact
3. SHITLOADS OF WATER

Some of this stuff is very confusing and there will be days where I feel like I know nothing. This is all going to get very, very hard BUT I can do it.

## Holistic Learning
* Why do I want to learn it?
* What do Iexpect to learn?
* What do I understand about the thing I want to learn right now?
* After I study, what do I understand about the thing I just learnt?
* Use my understanding to explain what I just learnt to a 5 year old

* Complete [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.com)
The following will increase my knowledge of 
1. JavaScript
2. Advanced programming languages and terminologies
3. Basic Project Planning
4. Critical Thinking

**The Result:** I will be able to solve sophisticated problems programatically.
Throughout this curriculum I am going to be writing code, since writing code is the only way to learn to write code.

Now it's time to use some of what I've learnt to build an online resume. If I used CodePen initially then create this locally and vice versa. 

Before I go deeper into JavaScipt and other programming theories, I will take the Harvard Computer Science course. The course covers 9 problem sets and will take between 10-20 hours each. 

The course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include:
* Abstraction           * Algorithms
* Sata Structures       * Encapsulation
* Resource Management   * Security
* Software Engineering  * Web Development

Languages include:
* C           * Python
* SQL         * JavaScript
* CSS         * HTML

Each problem is inspired by real world domains:
* Biology         * Cryptography
* Finance         * Forensics
* Gaming

Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets and a final project are eligible for a certificate.

You've come quite a ways but, we're not close to done yet. Now it's time to build an online Towers of Hanoiu Solver that accepts a tower height between 5 and 10, then displays a graphical (animated) solution, iteratively moving each piece until the puzzle is solved.
